# Rhiot - the messaging platform for the Internet Of Things

Rhiot itself is no more maintained. Instead it was migrated into two projects:
- Eclipse Kapua (general IoT backend platform) - https://github.com/eclipse/kapua
- Streamok (big data streams for IoT) - https://github.com/streamok/streamok

Rhiot is a messaging platform for the Internet Of Things. We are focused on an adoption of the
[Red Hat JBoss middleware portfolio](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware) to provide solutions to
the common IoT-related challenges.
