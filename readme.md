Rhiot is the messaging platform for the Internet Of Things. We are focused on an adoption of the
[Red Hat JBoss middleware portfolio](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware) to provide solutions to
the common IoT-related challenges.

Rhiot comes with the following features:
- [IoT gateway software](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#camel-iot-gateway)
- [Camel components for the IoT](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#camel-iot-components)
- [Backend cloud services (Rhiot Cloud)](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#rhiot-cloud)
- [Web console for managing the devices, gateways and Cloudlets](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#rhiot-cloud)
- IoT deployment utilities
- [Performance Testing Framework for the IoT gateways](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/blob/master/docs/readme.md#performance-testing-framework)
